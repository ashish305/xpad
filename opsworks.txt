check what is my sql instance in opswork
for mysql layer you will be requiring mysql instance and for that 
you can create an instance by 
1) opswork method --- was fine cant go further as somehow not allowing mysql to be accessed by my local machine --stucked at that
may be security groups of opswork not allowing it to hence 

solution to that you can change security group for that instance from ec2 dashboard
or 
you can add your custom security group to mysql layer 
1) it wont be effective for running mysql instance
-- 1.1) rebooting the instance -- cant restart after adding security 		     group --- setup failed 
--1.2) even after removing added security group -- on rebooting , 
	   setup failed 
 --1.3 ) have to make another mysqlinstance

check custom ami image part also
