check what is my sql instance in opswork
for mysql layer you will be requiring mysql instance and for that 
you can create an instance by 
1) opswork method --- was fine cant go further as somehow not allowing mysql to be accessed by my local machine --stucked at that
may be security groups of opswork not allowing it to hence 

solution to that you can change security group for that instance from ec2 dashboard
